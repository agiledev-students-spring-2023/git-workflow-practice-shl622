<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>ChatGPT has been a hot topic in the last few months and while its performance has proved to signal a new beginning for artificial intelligence, some worry that AI could replace many aspects of the normal life. The article mainly focuses on AI and its impact on education, which brings forth different opinions on whether AI can be beneficial or detrimental to learning.

I believe AI in general, not specific to ChatGPT, is beneficial as it allows computers to produce an output that is generated from a large set of data, which is a task that is difficult to achieve for humans in a short amount of time. In terms of education, however, AI or ChatGPT simply won't be able to replace the experience of learning. From personal experience, learning or mastering something comes from the process rather than the result, and without the constant trial-and-errors it would not be possible for students or anyone to fully understand a topic. Although legislative actions on systems such as ChatGPT in school systems may be debatable, I do not think AI can replace traditional education systems.</p>

<h2>Comment by Ashwin Rabindran</h2>
<p>I think that ChatGPT will start to challenge some of the flaws in our education system, but must be used carefully as a student. If you use ChatGPT to outsource all of your critical thinking, especially at a young age, you will be disadvantaged going forward in life, as it will be hard to solve and analyze important issues that have never been seen before and can be answered trivially by ChatGPT.
